#_Vacation Finder README_

###Created by Noah Kittleson

##**Description**
This is a webpage that contains a survey designed for the user to fill out, submit, and receive an answer to the age old question: where should I go on vacation?

##**How it Works**
This program works by having each option correspond to one of the 3 destinations you can get: Iceland, Patagonia, or Sumatra.  If you answer a question with the Sumatra answer, you get one "point" towards Sumatra.  When you hit "Submit", the program tallies up the "scores" for each country and displays those that have two or more points (out of four questions that actually USE that input).  This means you can have multiple results, i.e. answer 2 for sumatra, and 2 for Iceland, you get both Patagonia AND Iceland.  Selecting the "No Preference" option counts as a point towards all 3, meaning that if you select "No Preference" for each answer, you will get all 3 results.
